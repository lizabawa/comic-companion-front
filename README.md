## Project Approach 
- I used the project management application [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep track of project tasks, important links, and brainstorming ideas.
- My approach to this project was to create a bare bone front end first, then the backend, and then connect the two before completing any additional CSS.
- Before I began any coding, I planned my front-end out by creating a wireframe and user stories.


### User Stories


## Tools and Technologies Used

The following is a list of the tools and technologies that were employed in the development of this project:
 - **VS Code:** The code editor of choice, offering robust features for debugging and source code editing.
 - **HTML:** Utilized for creating the basic structure of the web application.
 - **CSS:** Employed for styling the HTML elements and improving the overall user interface.
 - **Angular:** A framework for building dynamic web applications, used to create a scalable and maintainable codebase.
