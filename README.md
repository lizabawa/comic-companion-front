## Project Approach 
- I used the project management application [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep track of project tasks, important links, and brainstorming ideas.
- My approach to this project was to create a bare bone front end first, then the backend, and then connect the two before completing any additional CSS.
- Before I began any coding, I planned my front-end out by creating a wireframe and user stories.
